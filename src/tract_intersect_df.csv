Port of Skagit intends to deploy and lease fiber for which it will receive leasing revenues; however, the lease agreements submitted with the application do not include payment terms. As a result, it was not possible to validate revenues received from the leasing arrangement. The application also did not indicate subscriber projections or otherwise recognize Local Network Service Revenues generated from the project. Furthermore, the application forecasts only revenues and expenses related to proposed broadband operations instead of aligning the pro forma with its historical financial statements to include the full financial activities of the entity. Because of this, Port of Skagit’s complete financial feasibility could not be determined.
The application also is missing information related to the access portion of the proposed network, as Port of Skagit’s plan to lease fiber to other entities requires those entities to use their own devices. This disqualifies the application from eligibility per the terms of the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Relatedly, because each lessee will use its own devices, the feasibility of system integration could not be determined.
In addition to the above, the application’s Proposed Funded Service Area (PFSAs) was identified as having at least 88% overlap with areas that the FCC has classified as eligible for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF).",NA,"941664401","ReConnect Program","Last Mile","Fiber-to-the-Premises",0,0,0,0,0,NA,1

South Tier Network (STN) plans to construct a fiber network for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to access and provide service to households within the Proposed Funded Service Areas (PFSA). While STN submitted letters of interest for two providers, the application did not include evidence of an ISP commitment to provide service from the network, and no service, operating, or leasing agreement was submitted to inform pro forma revenue assumptions. No subscriber projections were offered to validate projected leasing revenues assumed in the application, and without agreements submitted that outline arrangements with ISPs, the assumed pro forma operating expenses similarly could not be verified. In addition, STN will rely on a $4M dollar loan to enable coverage of matching fund requirements under the ReConnect grant, but the loan has not been secured and no potential lender was identified. Without such loan, the applicant does not have sufficient cash to cover the matching funds. Furthermore, the application does not provide any information about the core network or network integration. STN will lease the fiber for ISPs to provide service to end users, and these ISPs must provide the core network, OLT, ONT, and inside wiring. With no ISP secured, insufficient information was provided in the application to determine the project’s ability to offer the proposed services.",NA,"29527893","ReConnect Program","Last Mile","Fiber-to-the-Premises",0,0,0,0,0,NA,10

South Tier Network (STN) plans to construct a fiber network for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to access and provide service to households within the Proposed Funded Service Areas (PFSA). While STN submitted letters of interest for two providers, the application did not include evidence of an ISP commitment to provide service from the network, and no service, operating, or leasing agreement was submitted to inform pro forma revenue assumptions. No subscriber projections were offered to validate projected leasing revenues assumed in the application, and without agreements submitted that outline arrangements with ISPs, the assumed pro forma operating expenses similarly could not be verified. In addition, STN will rely on a $4M dollar loan to enable coverage of matching fund requirements under the ReConnect grant, but the loan has not been secured and no potential lender was identified. Without such loan, the applicant does not have sufficient cash to cover the matching funds. Furthermore, the application does not provide any information about the core network or network integration. STN will lease the fiber for ISPs to provide service to end users, and these ISPs must provide the core network, OLT, ONT, and inside wiring. With no ISP secured, insufficient information was provided in the application to determine the project’s ability to offer the proposed services.",NA,"29527893","ReConnect Program","Last Mile","Fiber-to-the-Premises",0,0,0,0,0,NA,10

The application included summary notes without any supporting financials. The application is ineligible because the pro forma assumptions are not supported, financially, calling into question the financial feasibility of the project due to the aggressive revenue growth forecast with only a moderate increase in expenses creating a significant disparity between revenue and expense growth. Additionally, the applicant has a lack of infrastructure or any documented experience in building or supporting a large broadband network. Further the technical team indicates the applicant has not specified ONT vendor, the network drawing is on a very high level, and the Network Design is very vague. Also, no PE certification was provided. The same is valid for the Distribution and Core networks. The applicant has not provided enough information to determine technical feasibility. The applicant has included several Operation Expenses ($100K Billing System, $150K Security Monitoring System) that are not eligible under the FOA. It should also be noted that the applicant has budgeted $40,747,904 for the 7 PFSA’s, but only $2,461,172 for the 7 NFSA’s. 6743 subscribers are projected for the PFSA’s, and 7174 subscribers are projected for the NFSA’s.

The applicant applied on a consolidated basis using its parent’s financials, however, those financial statements did not break out the applicant’s individual financials to allow for analysis of HughesNet as a stand-alone entity. As a result, we are unable to determine the applicant’s individual financial feasibility. Additionally, the project feasibility is dependent upon the successful launch of the applicant’s new Jupiter-3 satellite in 2021.

The applicant’s financial pro forma only includes broadband-related activities, and the most recent applicant financial statements submitted are from 2017. While Citynet, the vendor that will maintain and operate the network, is financially feasible based on their 2018 audit, the lack of historical data prevents reviewers from determining whether Citynet would be able to provide service at the proposed rates given the small number of subscribers, especially if subscriber numbers are lower than anticipated. Even with a guarantee of project construction completion, without making Citynet a party to the agreement and service obligation, financial feasibility of the network cannot be determined",NA,"2729333","ReConnect Program","Last Mile","Fiber-to-the-Premises",0,0,0,0,0,NA,35
